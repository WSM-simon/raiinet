# Master test runner - runs all test files using sequence command
# Usage: ./raiinet then type: sequence tests/run_all_tests.txt

# Note: Each sequence resets context but game state persists
# These tests should be run individually for proper testing

# To run all tests, use shell script instead:
# for f in tests/test_*.txt; do echo "=== $f ==="; ./raiinet < "$f" | tail -10; done

# Or run individual tests:
sequence tests/test_basic_movement.txt
quit
