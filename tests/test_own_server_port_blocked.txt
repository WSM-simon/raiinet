# Test that you cannot move onto your own server port

# Move c to be adjacent to own server port
move c right
# c at row 0, col 3? No, c starts at col 2

move A up

# Try different approach - move d up toward own server port
# d starts at row 1, col 3 (below server port)
move d up
# Should fail - can't move onto own server port!
